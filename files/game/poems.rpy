Dear {},
I wrote this letter with Yuri, she said she wants to give it to you, but somehow decided to let me do the favor, so here I am...
We’re sorry, for not being there when you needed us the most. I know it must have been a couple of rough weeks, I know what she meant to you...damn, she’s also a friend of mine! The most...irreplaceable one. None of us would have known about it, otherwise we would have definitely helped her!
Anyway, Monika said she’ll talk to you later, I wonder if you feel better by now?
I thought about it, about why would she do that...I guess something must have gone wrong. I was probably the last person to see her besides you, she did seem a little off that day, but that doesn’t mean.... Well I’m not making you remember it, maybe you know the answer, you just wouldn’t tell us. It’s not like I want you to tell me or anything, it’s still hard for you and I know it, so just keep it inside. You don’t have to reply to this letter either, if you don’t feel like it.
Yuri and I made a tomb for her in the school garden, I left tons of cupcakes and cookies by it, with various flavors you can only imagine! She can have whatever she wants this time, I won’t bother her. Others have also left something there, cards, flowers......that sort of thing. I’ve written her a letter, too, put it beisde those flowers...but it’s for her eyes only! So I’ll beat the shit out of you if you dare to take a peek!!!
Geez, sometimes I’m almost jealous of Sayori, she really has a number of friends out there. People visit the tomb every day now, either taking a walk or sitting around it, reading... I wonder if Sayori can hear their words...Well there were also some dickheads talking trash about her, I gave them what they deserved, so you don’t have to worry about that.
It’s not like I’m forcing you but...could you please visit the literature club? For the last time? Without you, there are two members missing...... Monika said we’ll probably have to disband... Ah! What a mess, I’ll have to bring my manga home again...where will I be able to hide them this time?
Fine, that’s all I have to say! Are the rumors right about you transferring? Oh great! Do what you want! You’ll be missing my cupcakes and I am already developing more flavors! It’s your loss I’m telling you!""".format(player),
            text = """{}, I don't know what you think, but I think death is not the end of all things. If you believe, Sayori maybe didn’t leave, maybe you will come across at some point in the future, in a different way perhaps, even without you noticing it.
People always say we should look forward, I believe you’ve heard enough of that these days, so I think those cliché shouldn’t come out beneath a friend’s pen. From my perspective, I think it is actually unnecessary to put her down, unnecessary to ‘look forward’. If you by any chance accept my idea----I want you to remember Sayori forever, not just to remember her physical form, but also her soul, what she had brought you.
Life and society, they just won’t get tired of changing and being cruel. Think about it this way---- Sayori is gone, but also she will never change again. Only will your happiest moments stay once the memory starts to blur. And you won’t have to worry about whether you will drift apart or how she will change, or even become strangers. Of course, in such a shameful way, it is something that will take your time.
Besides all that, I would also like to learn about what had actually happened to Sayori. But, Nat told me to not push you, I think it’s reasonable. In fact, I’m quite surprised to see her saying things like that, I guess Sayori did bring numerous changes to us.
I heard about you planning to transfer, where would you transfer specifically? It’s highly possible that we won’t meet that often from now on, so I gave you another gift, a book about life and living, I really love the way its author writes about a person's inner feelings. Now that I think of it, I could even see some of Sayori’s thoughts from it. I’m leaving it inside your cabinet----if you are ever returning to school.
I didn’t know you for very long, you probably think I’m ghosting you because of that. I’m going to apologize for it, I admit, I don’t know you as well as Sayori does, so I fear that I could make it worse if I say something wrong, hence the alienation. I’m sorry, you must be hating me right now since I’m also responsible for Sayori’s tragedy.
It seems that the literature club has come to an end now, we could only recall the fore silhouette of that classroom from yellowing pages and occasional reminiscent henceforward. I give you my total understanding if you want to just leave all of this behind, I hope you find yourself a better future in a better surrounding. I wish you the best.""".format(player),

你好{}，
这封信是我跟优里一起写给你的，本来优里说她想给你，但最后她还是决定让我来。
真的很抱歉没能在你最艰难的时候陪着你，过去的几周一定对你来说很艰难。我们都知道纱世里对你的意义，她也是我们的好朋友，发生这种事真的都是我们大家没能想到的可能。莫妮卡说她会来跟你谈谈，不知道你现在有没有好点呢？
冷静下来过后，我也想过纱世里为什么会做那种事。除了你之外，我应该是最后一个见到她的了，那天我确实感觉她有点怪怪的，我想一定是出什么事了。但逼迫你去回忆有点不太好，我想你一定知道答案吧，只是你不愿意告诉我们。我也不是希望你一定要告诉我们，如果你还是难以开口的话，也不用回复这封信，把它好好留着吧。
我和优里在花园里给纱世里做了一个墓碑，我做了很多杯子蛋糕和曲奇饼干放在旁边，什么味道的都有，这一次她想吃多少就吃多少，我绝不拦着她。同学们还放了很多东西在那里，各种各样的都有。我也给她写了一首诗，但是是写给她的，所以你不能看！
我真的好羡慕纱世里，她的朋友真多，现在每天都有很多人走到花园那里去，要不是散步，要不就是呆在一旁看书，不知道纱世里能不能听到她们小声的交流呢？不过也有一些人说她的坏话，都给我狠狠地骂回去了！所以你放心吧！
虽然没有强迫你，不过你能回文学部看看吗？没有你，我们就少了两个人了……莫妮卡说，我们有可能要解散了……真是的，我的漫画又得带回家里了……这次又藏在哪里好呢？……
好吧，我要说的就这么多了！你是不是要转学啊？！你想转就转吧！反正以后吃不到我的杯子蛋糕，吃亏的是你！而且告诉你，我最近已经开始研究其他的糕点了！你自己看着办！！！""".format(player),

人生与社会是富于变化且残酷的。往好的方面想，纱世里这么走了，她也就永远不会改变了，在你日渐模糊的记忆里，只有那些最精彩的细节会被保留下来，而你也不需要去担心她会因为什么而改变，你们之间会因为什么而渐行渐远。当然，以这样一种令人遗憾的方式，对你来说确实需要时间去接受。
对于纱世里，我也挺想问问你到底发生什么了，但夏树告诉我还是算了，能看到她说出这样的话，还真是令人惊讶。我想纱世里的确让我们改变了很多吧……
听说你要转学了，不知道你要转到哪里去呢？以后见面的机会可能不多了，我送了你一本关于生命和生活的小说，它里面对于心理的描写我真的很喜欢，现在回想起来，我似乎也能从中窥见一丝纱世里的想法。我就把它放在你的柜子里——如果你还要回学校来拿东西的话。
我认识你不太久，你一定觉得我是因为跟你不熟才刻意回避你吧。在这里我要说声对不起，我承认我不了解你，我觉得如果说错了什么，可能会让你更难过，所以干脆选择了逃避。你一定很讨厌我吧，因为纱世里变成这样，我也要负很大责任。
文学部也要就此画上句号了，今后我们只能从发黄的纸页和偶然的回忆性描述里看到那个教室曾经的幻影。你要是想把我的回忆都扔开，我可以理解，希望你在新的环境里一切都好，我真诚地祝福你。""".format(player),
